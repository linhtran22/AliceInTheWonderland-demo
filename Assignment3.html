          Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
          bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
          the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
          conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice
          ‘without pictures or conversations?’
        </p>

        <p>
          So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
          hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
          making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
          picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
          close by her.
        </p>

        <p>
          There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
          so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh
          dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards,
          it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
          time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
          watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried
          on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
          had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
          watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
          the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
          down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
          in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight
          on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so
          suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself
          before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
